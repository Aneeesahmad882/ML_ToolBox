    "The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency used to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. Here are the key differences and how they are calculated:\n",

    "1-Mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and provides a measure of the average value in the dataset. It is commonly used in situations where the distribution of values is roughly symmetrical and not highly skewed.\n",

    "2-Median:\n",
    "Calculation: The middle value when the dataset is ordered. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "3-Mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: The value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "Use: The mode is useful when you want to identify the most common value(s) in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they are used together:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a symmetrical distribution with no outliers, the mean, median, and mode are often very close to each other.\n",
    "In a skewed distribution or one with outliers, the median might be a better indicator of central tendency than the mean.\n",
    "The mode is useful for identifying the most common values, but a dataset may have no mode or multiple modes.\n",
